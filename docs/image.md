# Images and Containers

In this section we discuss operations to build images and manipulation of containers.

To learn more, here are working examples for you to experiment:

* Building a container and adding non-root users
* Building a container with a RESTFul server

## Building a Container and Adding Non-root Users

* [Builder](../build/builder.yaml)
* [Docker file](../build/nonroot.dockerfile)
* [Example 1](../scripts/ex1.sh) -- this script provide operations to access the inner working of the container

## Building a Containers with a RESTFul server

* [Builder](../build/builder.yaml)
* [Docker image build](../build/restserver.dockerfile)
* [Source code for RESTful server](../cmd/restserver/main.go)
